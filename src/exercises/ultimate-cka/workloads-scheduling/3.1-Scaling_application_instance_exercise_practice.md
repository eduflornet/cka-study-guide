# Scaling Application Instance **exercise practice**

- In this Exercise:
You will deploy sample application, then you will scale-up and scale-down applications.

- NOTE: 
a. To successfully finish this exercise, It is important to go through Deployment and Scaling Applications Concept and Demo videos in this series.
b. You can refer to Kuberenetes Docs for help when needed.

STEP-1: Create Deployment:
--------------------------
a. Create Deployment with below configuration using "kubectl create..." command

Deployment Name: nginx-deploy
Container Image: nginx
Replicas: 3

```bash
kubectl create deploy nginx-deploy --image nginx --replicas 3
```

STEP-2: Scale-UP Deployments:
-----------------------------
a. Scale up "nginx-deploy" deployment from 3 to 5 replicas by running "...scale..." command

```bash
kubectl scale deploy nginx-deploy --replicas 5
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy scaled
```


b. Display "nginx-deploy" deployment and ensure "Ready" is 5/5.

```bash
kubectl get deploy nginx-deploy -o wide
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE    CONTAINERS   IMAGES   SELECTOR
nginx-deploy   5/5     5            5           3m9s   nginx        nginx    app=nginx-deploy
```

STEP-3: Scale-DOWN Deployments:
-------------------------------
a. Scale-DOWN "nginx-deploy" deployment from 5 to 3 replicas by running "...scale..." command

```bash
kubectl scale deploy nginx-deploy --replicas 3
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy scaled
```

b. Display "nginx-deploy" deployment and ensure "Ready" is 3/3.

```bash
ubectl get deploy nginx-deploy -o wide
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE     CONTAINERS   IMAGES   SELECTOR
nginx-deploy   3/3     3            3           4m59s   nginx        nginx    app=nginx-deploy
```

STEP-4: Delete the Deployment:
------------------------------
a. Delete the "nginx-deploy" deployment.

```bash
kubectl delete deploy nginx-deploy --force
Warning: Immediate deletion does not wait for confirmation that the running resource has been terminated. The resource may continue to run on the cluster indefinitely.
deployment.apps "nginx-deploy" force deleted
```

b. Display Deployment, ReplicaSet and Pods. Ensure "nginx-deploy" Deployemnt is related. Also related ReplicaSet and Pods

```bash
kubectl get deploy nginx-deploy
Error from server (NotFound): deployments.apps "nginx-deploy" not found

kubectl get rs | grep nginx-deploy
No resources found in default namespace.

kubectl get pods | grep nginx-deploy
No resources found in default namespace.
```
