# JSON PATH Lab

Always bear in mind that your own resolution to success is more important than any other one thing.

â€“ Abraham Lincoln

1. Develop a JSON PATH query to extract the kind of object. A file named **q1.json** is provided in the terminal. Your task is to develop a JSON path query to extract the expected output from the Source Data.

Expected output should be like this

```json
[
  "value1"
]
```

You can test the JSON PATH query as below (noted that the query below is just sample, not a solution).

```bash
cat q1.json | jpath '$.property1'
[
  "value1"
]
```

If the output matched the expectation then write the whole command into a file named answer1.sh in the /root directory.

2. Develop a JSON PATH query to extract the kind of object. A file named **q2.json** is provided in the terminal. Your task is to develop a JSON path query to extract the expected output from the Source Data.

Expected output should be like this

```json
[
  {
    "color": "white",
    "price": "$120,000"
  }
]
```

You can test the JSON PATH query as below (noted that the query below is just sample, not a solution).

```bash
cat q2.json | jpath '$.property1'
[
  "value1"
]
```

If the output matched the expectation then write the whole command into a file named **answer2.sh** in the /root directory.

```bash
cat q2.json | jpath '$.bus'
