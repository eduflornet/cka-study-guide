# JSON PATH Lab

Always bear in mind that your own resolution to success is more important than any other one thing.

 ðŸ§ª **Practical examples**

Using jsonpath (built into kubectl)

```bash
kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'
```
Using jq (requires pipe)

```bash
kubectl get pods -o json | jq '.items[].metadata.name'
```
Using jpath (requires pipe and npm installed)

```bash
kubectl get pods -o json | jpath '$.items[*].metadata.name'
```

ðŸ§  Which one should you choose?
jsonpath: Ideal for simple scripts and when you want to avoid external dependencies. But its syntax can be limited and somewhat rigid.

**jq:** Perfect for advanced processing, filtering, and data transformation. Widely used by administrators and DevOps.

jpath: Useful if you're already familiar with JSONPath and prefer that syntax, but it's not as common or as powerful as jq.


1. Develop a JSON PATH query to extract the kind of object. A file named **q1.json** is provided in the terminal. Your task is to develop a JSON path query to extract the expected output from the Source Data.

Expected output should be like this

```json
[
  "value1"
]
```

You can test the JSON PATH query as below (noted that the query below is just sample, not a solution).

```bash
cat q1.json | jpath '$.property1'
[
  "value1"
]
```

**answer1.sh**

```bash
echo "cat q1.json | jpath '\$.property1'" > answer1.sh
cat q1.json | jpath '$.property1' >> answer1.sh
```

If the output matched the expectation then write the whole command into a file named answer1.sh in the /root directory.

2. Develop a JSON PATH query to extract the kind of object. A file named **q2.json** is provided in the terminal. Your task is to develop a JSON path query to extract the expected output from the Source Data.

Expected output should be like this

```json
[
  {
    "color": "white",
    "price": "$120,000"
  }
]
```

You can test the JSON PATH query as below (noted that the query below is just sample, not a solution).

```bash
cat q2.json | jpath '$.property1'
[
  "value1"
]
```

If the output matched the expectation then write the whole command into a file named **answer2.sh** in the /root directory.

```bash
cat q2.json | jpath '$.bus'
[
  {
    "color": "white",
    "price": "$120,000"
  }
]
```

```bash
echo "cat q2.json | jpath '$.bus'" > answer2.sh
cat q2.json | jpath '$.bus'' >> answer2.sh
```

**answer2.sh**

```sh
cat q2.json | jpath '$.bus'
[
  {
    "color": "white",
    "price": "$120,000"
  }
]
```


3. Develop a JSON PATH query to extract the kind of object. A file named **q3.json** is provided in the terminal. Your task is to develop a JSON path query to extract the expected output from the Source Data.

```bash
cat q3.json | jpath '$.property1'
[
  "value1"
]
```

If the output matched the expectation then write the whole command into a file named answer3.sh in the /root directory.

```bash
echo "cat q3.json | jpath '$.bus.price'" > answer3.sh
cat q3.json | jpath '$.bus.price' >> answer3.sh

```bash
echo "cat q4.json | jpath '$.vehicles.car.price'" > answer4.sh
cat q4.json | jpath '$.vehicles.car.price' >> answer4.sh
